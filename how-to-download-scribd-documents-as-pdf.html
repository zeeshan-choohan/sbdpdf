            <h2 class="heading-text">How to Copy Text from Scribd ?</h2>
            <p><strong>Understanding the Challenge : </strong>Scribd often employs anti-copy mechanisms to protect copyrighted content. This can make directly copying and pasting text difficult. However, there are a few workarounds you can try :</p>
            <p><strong>Method 1: Screenshot and OCR</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Take a Screenshot :</strong> Capture a screenshot of the page or paragraph you want to copy.</p>
             <p><strong>Use an OCR Tool :</strong> Employ an optical character recognition (OCR) tool to convert the image into text. Popular OCR apps and online services include :</p>
             <p><strong>Adobe Acrobat</strong></p>
             <p><strong>Google Drive (Scan feature)</strong></p>
             <p><strong>Online OCR tools like OnlineOCR.net or NewOCR.com</strong></p>
             <p><strong>Copy and Paste :</strong> Once the OCR has converted the image into text, you can copy and paste it into your desired document.</p>
            <p><strong>Method 2: Manual Typing or Dictation</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Type Manually :</strong> If the text is relatively short, you can manually type it out.</p>
            <p><strong>Use Dictation :</strong> If your device supports dictation, you can speak the text and have it transcribed.</p>
